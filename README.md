Parsenal
====================

### An assortment of Arsenal parsers

Basically, scrapes articles I want off of Arsenal.com which was a few hours of work.

Then where most of the work is the "second screen" one-page thing. 

I wanted marginally relevant information to have on my other/second screen during a match.

- League table as it stands
- Our team, their team including subs and when people are subbed off.
- Next 4 matches
- Our recent form, and opponents recent form.
- Co-opted a quantity of data from Opta (indirectly) to plug into D3 graph front and center.

## Sources:

- Arsenal.com
- Stats FC API
- BBC Sport  
- Squawka...

> Please don't use this by the way, I feel it's kind of deep already when it's just me.
