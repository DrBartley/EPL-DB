    title "Koscielny - Fans are crazy in Marseille"
    body "Laurent Koscielny says he is looking forward to experiencing the 'crazy' atmosphere at Stade Velodrome on Wednesday evening.
The French defender has fond childhood memories of watching the likes of Chris Waddle and Jean-Pierre Papin representing Marseille.
Koscielny was part of the Arsenal team that beat Marseille when the sides met in the Champions League two seasons ago and is relishing a return to south France."
